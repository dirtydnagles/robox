why typescript 
    better to catch errors than have things fail at run time
    great form of documentation (readibility)

declaring a type:
    var foo: number = '123' // Error: cannot assign a string to a number





Question for sam
why does this work? 
    function iTakePoint2d(point: Point2D) {do something}
    iTakePoint2D({x:0 y:0 z:10}) ???
